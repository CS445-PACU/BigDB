## PHP

Install the [PHP-Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug).

You don't need to do any further configuration to get PHP or the debugger to work.

Use VS Code to open the folder PHP.  This folder contains an example PHP file and the necessary configuration to get the debugger working.
